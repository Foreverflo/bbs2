Hello!
The original project was blocked. Here's a new one.
This is much more limited as many of the unblockers are not in development anymore and of the ones that are, many of them are already blocked. The ones that still do work are very complicated to install, and if you are here I assume you don't know how to do that. For now, then, here is a proxy site you can host.
# Before you use:
Make sure you have a GitHub account if you want to host your own server.
# Setting up:

## If you want to host your own server, follow the steps below:

1. Go to [Interstellar](https://github.com/InterstellarNetwork/Interstellar) and create a *Fork*. The fork button is in the top right corner.

2. Once you have your fork and are on its page, press the green *Code* button, then *Codespaces*, *Create or Add a new codespace*.

3a. Once you are in your codespace and it is fully loaded, type in the terminal onscreen: *pnpm i && pnpm start*.

3b. You will only have to do step 3a once. Every time after, just type pnpm start.

4. A popup will appear. Make sure you press *Make Public*.

5. Go to the Ports tab, and find the running port. Click on the URL under *Forwarded Address*.

6. Please make sure to *turn off advertisements in settings*, or it will constantly redirect you to virus websites.

*Remember, you must open your codespace and do steps 3b and 5 if you close the codespace for too long, and you should keep the codespace open during use.*
